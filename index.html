          ....but first, a quick intro to my Website
        </h2>
        <p>
          This website is about deep diving into my experiences where you will
          look at all of my work connected with my interests. Even building this
          website from scratch will itself be a part of my portfolio. This
          website is totally made by me without depending on any constraints
          where I have to follow somebody else's guideline or layout. I believe
          in Independent Ownership where I, as a designer, can showcase my
          progress and share personal knowledge. It is a safe platform where you
          will flow freely.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you'll give time in the exploration, it may assist you with many
          resources and insights as well. I will be updating my website in every
          6 months and always try to make it feel like a friend sharing his
          experiences to another friend.

        <p>
          Curious and detail-driven Communication Design student with a strong
          focus on UX, interaction design, and narrative thinking. I approach
          design through the lens of empathy and logic, balancing research,
          storytelling, and structure to craft experiences that resonate.
        </p>
        <p>
          With roots in sustainable product design, my mindset is grounded in
          ethics and a sense of responsibility toward society. I'm currently
          exploring how people interact, decide, react and feel and then focus
          on translating insights into intentional flows and intuitive
          interfaces. I work best in collaborative, hands-on environments and
          believe in designing with clarity and purpose.

              I completed a Training and Internship Programme where I learned the basics of User Experience and User Interface Design from an industry expert and gained hands-on experience through various projects.

             As a Product Designer, I worked with multiple NGOs to redesign products and improve manufacturing processes, bringing in innovative design ideas. I contributed to the Bamboo Craft Design for Sustainable Development Workshop by MBPF and MITID, and co-created new products with Bamboo Masters, a bamboo handicrafts and furniture enterprise.
